# What I doing here:

This repo is meant to build upon my [previous](https://github.com/lukin41280/ShotAdjuster) Ruby application that runs on Sinatra.  I want to build out the back-end in Rails to get more practice and to use it as an API be able to change the front-end to whatever platform I wish in the future.  I am also looking to utilize Travis CI to get a feel for continuous integration services.
